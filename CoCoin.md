I was unable to setup the environment on my macbook / pc, therefore I was unable to fully complete this task and automate the test cases. However I did manage to run the app. 

What to be tested/automated:

- PIN Entry / Logging in
- Expenses entry
- Custom view
- Tags view
- Months view
- List view
- Expense report
- Settings
- Help
- Feedback
- About

Manual test

- Labels / translations | Currently text within application is very confusing 
- UI Design / Colors / Font / Layout
